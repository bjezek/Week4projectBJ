# Analyze the Performance
S&P 500 greatly outperform the other funds over the duration from 2015-2019
with Tiger Global managemnt following behind then I would take Berkshire Hathaway after that
based on return/risk reward. Based on these graphs and info it would be best to invest into the S&P500 index. 

# Analyze the Volatility
Based on Plot box showing the cumulative returns, showing Tiger Golbal capital & Paulson & co being very volatile, as 
the Berkshire Hathaway being the least volatile.
